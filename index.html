                    <br> - All original art assets and music. 
                    <br> - 5 levels with ascending difficulty.
                    <br> - Unique platforming mechanics (Wall jumps, jump canceling, speed meter, overheating).
                    <br> - An in-game “tutorial” to teach the player while not impeding gameplay. 
                    <br> - An online leaderboard to compare times with other players. </i>

            <div>
                <br>This project was a big step up from my last one. I chose a very similar art style, however this time I made all the assets myself.
                <br><br>I was very conservative about designing the game in a way that allowed for a small number of assets to be used many times. I 
                created a simple tileset that I used through every level. I created one obstacle and one enemy type, as well as one simple 
                background. The player character animations were limited to:  run, jump, fall, wall slide, hurt, spawn, and attack.                
                <br><br>To keep the scope small enough to be completed within 72 hours, the levels were fairly short and the menus were 
                bare-bones.

            <br><br>
            <div style="font-size: large;"><b>Reflection and Issues</b></div>
            <div>
                <br>I was very happy with this project compared to the previous. It was a huge improvement as well as a much larger scope. 
                Even so, there were still a lot of issues with the game that I would change in retrospect.
                <br><br>The difficulty progression was the biggest issue with this project. At the start of the game the difficulty ramps 
                up at a normal pace. The player is learning new things in each section, and the levels are short to allow quick resets. 
                After the player is taught all the basic mechanics, the difficulty goes way up, and the levels get longer.
                <br><br>The main thing I realized about difficulty progression is that players will initially be much worse than me at my 
                game. I was worried that the game would be too easy because it was easy for me... the developer. This sounds obvious but 
                it didn’t occur to me just how much of a learning curve most games have. I was designing a game that felt good for me 
                specifically, so I was just about the worst judge of level difficulty.
                <br><br>This leads into the next important thing I learned, which is that you need playtesters. I watched my friend play 
                the game after the jam was finished, and it instantly revealed 10 different things that I wanted to change. Playtesting 
                is king.

            <div>
                <br>The experience of finishing a fully playable game under a time crunch was the most valuable part of this project. 
                It helped me understand much more clearly what it takes to build a game from start to finish. This game was short, simple, 
                and deeply flawed, but it was a very valuable project for understanding the game development process.
                <br><br>I gained a lot of pixel art experience throughout this project. The character animations had to be conveyed through 
                a very small canvas size while still being clear and readable. I created simple backgrounds and implemented a 
                background/foreground parallax effect.
                
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <div style="font-size: large;"><b>Reflection and Issues</b></div>
            <div>
                <br>There were a lot of mistakes made during the design and development of this project. There were a lot of small things 
                that I would certainly change in retrospect. However, the single biggest problem is apparent as soon as you play the game 
                for a few minutes. The biggest issue with this game is that it’s <i>just not fun to play</i>.
                <br><br>The core gameplay loop gets boring very quickly, and then doesn’t improve at all as the game goes on. There was 
                not nearly enough time spent figuring out what makes the game fun, and that resulted in a game that is... not fun!
                <br><br>I noticed this problem about halfway through the game jam. I thought that maybe the game would improve once I 
                add more features, or once I improve the aesthetics, or add better music. The truth is, a bad game is bad no matter how 
                pretty it looks.
                <br><br> The most important thing I learned from this project is to <i>make sure the core gameplay loop is fun</i>. It sounds 
                simple, but it's easy to lose sight of this amidst all the other things that need to be done to make a game.
